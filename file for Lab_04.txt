In the gaslit splendor of late 19th-century New York, rage builds inside 14-year-old Daphne. 
The sudden death of her father has left her alone with her irresponsible, grief-stricken mother—who becomes easy prey 
for a group of occultists promising to contact her dead husband. While fighting to disentangle her mother from these 
charlatans, Daphne begins to sense a strange, insidious presence in her own body...an entity with unspeakable appetites. 
What does “Brother” want? And could she even stop him if she tried?
